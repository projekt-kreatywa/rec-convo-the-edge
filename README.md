rec-convo-the-edge

is an impertinent shot at collaborative work with only one person involved being aware of any collaboration. sounds crazy? well i've done this before so i know what i'm talking about.

the initial code was writen by [ge1doot](http://codepen.io/ge1doot/) in his awesome composition [recorded conversations](http://codepen.io/ge1doot/pen/pvXYMG).

from there it was forked several times by [rafszul](http://codepen.io/rafszul/) and molested mercilessly for few days and nights.

then came the awesome [Edgy Ziane](https://www.facebook.com/EdgyZiane/timeline) with his graphical talents matching the programing skills of [ge1doot](http://codepen.io/ge1doot/) and practice of digital voodoo of [rafszul](http://codepen.io/rafszul/).

all that was needed to make it into an awesome digital enchantment was drumms and music to match the three previously mentioned talents. and where to find something better than on the soundcloud feed of the one and the only digital shaman from helsinki awesome [KOZILEK](https://soundcloud.com/kozilek). the sound used is his remix of original soundtrack to Journey by akane which ended up on the official release. check it out and eventualy purchase the whole lot [here](http://store.bravewave.net/album/journey).

and that's all folks.
